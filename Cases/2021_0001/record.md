### Significance
During the court, High spammed messages and reactions that are not related to the case, then testify in Vietnamese which may result in misunderstanding for a Defence lawyer. The Defendant was also prosecuted as a full citizen without juvenile privileges.

__Count 1:__ the Prosecution started with interviewing the witnesses, giving 9 different exhibits. The Defense lawyer decided to rest his case after saying that Defendant action is a raid.

__Count 2 & 3:__ the Prosecution then asked the Judge to confirm evidence privately as the content of the evidence is sensitive, then proceed to prove that Defendant is having the IP address and is obtaining it illegally. 

The Defense lawyer gave up and resigned on the Court during his counter-argument. 

__Count 4 & 5:__ the Prosecution presented a video that was sent to the victim where a man was beheaded and shown evidence that the victim was traumatized after watching the video

The Jury then considered Defendant guilty on all counts and suggested an indefinite ban because the victim is juvenile and this is a severe crime, which the Judge agreed and followed the suggestion

## Notes
Initially, the Court cannot find a defense lawyer for Defendant but then Dravo rejoined the server to be the lawyer for Dravo.

The reason for the Court to proceed with only one juror is because most of the people who were contacted by the judge refused to become the Jury for this case.
