**Prosecutor:** callmepeter#1300\
**Defense lawyer:** BluBoy1#3116\
**Jury:** 3 Jurors

### Significance
This can be seen as a test trial for the "Criminal Proceeding Act" that the Congress is writting. The Jury was challenged and diliberated anonymously via an app that was sent to each Jury individually.

## Notes
### Trial proceadure Judge assessment
This trial is the first trial that assumes "Criminal Proceeding Act" was enacted.

**The Jury challenge/deliberation application:** the application still lacks of security feature and only have very basic interface. The Judge didn't prevent the Jurors from discovering others' indentity. During Jury deliberation, there is no way to make sure the Jury is still active. 

**Oath/Affirm:** The witnesses didn't take any affirm/oath when testify.

**Time management:** Jury challenge session started one day before trial.
